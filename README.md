# AI Planet Data Science Bootcamp Project
## Project as part of 5 Week Data Science Bootcamp

As part of the 5 Week Data Science bootcamp organized by AI Planet formerly DPhi, I had to participate in a datathon where I used Machine Learning and Tuning to create a model that identifies if a patient will survive through thier condition or not.

I enjoy tutorials and datathons organized by AI Planet and really liked how I felt comfortable with programming, coding and understanding data.

Feel free to explore the notebook and enjoy learning ðŸ˜ƒ
